# Learning from a First Exploration of Workshop Remote Teaching

TL;DR



Bullet Points:

Background:
* Postgraduate+ workshops in reasearch software skills
* Primarily postgraduate research students, across University, STEM including HHS, Management
* [Version control](https://arc-lessons.github.io/version-control-git) && [Working with data](https://arc-lessons.github.io/intro-data-plotting)
* [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) style courses
* These two of our courses have clear instructions, relatively few exercises

Aims:
* Aim to expand broader Research Software Skills programme
* PG+ Participants from all faculties in the University with an interest developing their Python/Data skills
* We want to improve digital-programming literacy enabling more efficient working and reproducible research
* Previously taught face-to-face workshops in computer workrooms with PG demo

Action + Impact:
* Delivered in Teams using a 'Class' team.
* Meeting in channel '<Course name>'
* Anyone in Team can join/choose to add to calendar
* Chat used for questions
* Simple polling using @forms
* This style of team has 'Class notebooks' including individual private notebooks for students to receive 1-2-1 support
* We managed to field all questions in chat via text/presenter.
* 15 minute 'Intro How are we gong to use teams'
* 10 minute 'How we advise students to follow' managing: teams-tutorial material-programming workspace
* Generally went well
* Gremlins first time out
  - students unable to join meeting: created new meeting in general channel
  - overheated ethernet port in laptop hub - switched to port on laptop
* Ran smoothly second time round
* Need to check that class notebooks works as a sharing platform for our needs went unused through both sessions

Reflections:
**The good:**
* Tried and tested material and pltform survived transition unchanged
* Teams stood up well
* Appropriate use of polls (we used @forms 'Polly' also been suggested for Teams) 
  - ready to move on
  - knowledge check

**The not so good**
* Difficult with little feedback from students
* Repeated the 'how we are going to use the platform' took time out, but did refine how we do things
* Demonstrators to have clearly assigned roles

**For next time**
* Make sustained use of forms to check knowledge and continuation
* One demonstrator assigned as: Narrator to summarise key points in chat 
  - good pedagogy
  - reinforce what we're doing
  - what we've done
* One demonstrator pre-armed with questions to ask during teaching and to post continuation polls to verify progress

**Lessons to learn**
* Make sure that there are plenty of exercises and stop talking more (it's a workshop not a lecture)
* Feels like we have less time, can't just turn up in the same way
* Requires more prep, at least the first few times
* Prerecord the how-to-use-teams, how-to-use-the-platform and ask particpants to watch in advance.
